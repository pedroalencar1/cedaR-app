`cedaR` ([github.com/pedroalencar1/cedaR/](https://github.com/pedroalencar1/cedaR/)) is a package to process climatic data (preferably from DWD and ECA&D) to obtain changes in drought features (duration and severity) using Copula and Entropy theories.

This app is a simple implementation for dynamic visualization of the outputs of `cedaR` in 29 long-running stations in Europe, showing the changes in SDF and extreme event occurrence over the last 100 years.
